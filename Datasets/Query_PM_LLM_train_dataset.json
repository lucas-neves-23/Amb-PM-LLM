After testing, patients typically receive IV Liquid and IV Antibiotics, which often lead to Admission NC or to Admission IC in some cases . Post-admission NC, patients may undergo repeated testing (e.g., Admission NC \u2192 Leucocytes/CRP) or be discharged via Release A (common) or other release types (B, C, D, E), with Return ER sometimes occurring after release."

Following this, diagnostic tests (Leucocytes, CRP, LacticAcid) are frequently done in parallel (e.g., Leucocytes \u2194 CRP) to monitor conditions. After testing, patients typically receive IV Liquid and IV Antibiotics, which often lead to Admission NC or to Admission IC in some cases . Post-admission NC, patients may undergo repeated testing (e.g., Admission NC \u2192 Leucocytes/CRP) or be discharged via Release A (common) or other release types (B, C, D, E), with Return ER sometimes occurring after release."

After testing, patients typically receive IV Liquid and IV Antibiotics, which often lead to Admission NC or to Admission IC in some cases . Post-admission NC, patients may undergo repeated testing (e.g., Admission NC \u2192 Leucocytes/CRP) or be discharged via Release A (common) or other release types (B, C, D, E), with Return ER sometimes occurring after release."

Following this, diagnostic tests (Leucocytes, CRP, LacticAcid) are frequently done in parallel (e.g., Leucocytes \u2194 CRP) to monitor conditions. After testing, patients typically receive IV Liquid and IV Antibiotics, which often lead to Admission NC or to Admission IC in some cases . Post-admission NC, patients may undergo repeated testing (e.g., Admission NC \u2192 Leucocytes/CRP) or be discharged via Release A (common) or other release types (B, C, D, E), with Return ER sometimes occurring after release."

Following this, diagnostic tests (Leucocytes, CRP, LacticAcid) are frequently done in parallel (e.g., Leucocytes \u2194 CRP) to monitor conditions. After testing, patients typically receive IV Liquid and IV Antibiotics, which often lead to Admission NC or to Admission IC in some cases . Post-admission NC, patients may undergo repeated testing (e.g., Admission NC \u2192 Leucocytes/CRP) or be discharged via Release A (common) or other release types (B, C, D, E), with Return ER sometimes occurring after release."
